# Memeing Experts
#### created by: John Cornici

View the [Memeing Experts](http://johnthedudeman.github.io/memeing_experts/) webpage, and let me know what you think.

I created this meme generator to help me learn programing. I was never really into memes, but now I find myself using *Meming Experts* on a regular basis.

I welcome suggestions and feedback. I also encourage anyone to work on this project.  

### Current Features

- Template memes have their corresponding preview syntax
- Random pepe generator with over 1,000 pepes
- All generated images are stored at bottom of page durring session


### Future Features

- Share button (social network, email, etc)
- Track templates used
- Use all original content (except random pepe(maybe one day))
